Before building, make sure you have checked out the git submodules by running `git submodule update`. You can then run `make` to download and set up [Fabrice Bellard's disk images][images] and create the project file. Finally, open `TinyEMU-iOS.xcodeproj`, change the code signing settings as needed and run.
